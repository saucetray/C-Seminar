gcc - command to compiler
-o [exec] the name of the exec you want to use
-c the name of the object file

-Wall - Enable warnings about constructors and language specific warnings
-Wextra - Other errors not in Wall
-pedantic - The most annoying compiler flag yelling at you for nothing like empty structs 
-Werror - Make every warning an error [Only if you want to suffer]


Examples:
gcc -o dog dog.c -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Werror
gcc -c dog.c -Wall
